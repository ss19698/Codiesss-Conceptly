3. Then re-teach each weak area using {current_approach}
4. Connect prerequisites to weak areas explicitly
5. Use simple language, avoid jargon
6. Include concrete examples and analogies
7. Build understanding step-by-step

Create a comprehensive re-explanation (500-800 words) that ensures understanding.""")
